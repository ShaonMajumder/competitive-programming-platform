# Competitive Programming Platform

![Laravel CI](https://github.com/ShaonMajumder/competitive-programming-platform/actions/workflows/laravel.yml/badge.svg)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ShaonMajumder/competitive-programming-platform/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ShaonMajumder/competitive-programming-platform)

A full-featured platform for compiling, executing, and judging code submissions across multiple languages — ideal for coding contests or training environments.

## 🚀 Demo

### ✅ Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

**Figure:** GitHub Actions running PHPUnit tests, when pushed to main branch
![CI Demo](screenshots/ci_2025-05-19%2012-25-57.gif)

🔄 On each push/PR to main, GitHub Actions sets up PHP, MySQL, Redis, installs dependencies, configures Laravel, runs migrations & PHPUnit tests—failing on issues to block broken PRs.

➡️ Config: .github/workflows/laravel.yml

## 🎯 Features for Users

-   **📝 Online Code Editor**  
    Write and test code directly in the browser using a modern **Monaco Editor** (used by VS Code).

-   **🌐 Multi-Language Support**  
    Submit code in popular languages like **C++, Python**, and more (extensible).

-   **⚙️ Real-Time Code Evaluation**  
    Get instant feedback on submissions — outputs, errors, and verdicts are displayed in real-time.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Area             | Technologies Used                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**     | ReactJS, Monaco Editor                           |
| **Backend**      | Laravel (PHP), RESTful APIs                      |
| **Queue System** | Redis Queue (RabbitMQ planned)                   |
| **Database**     | MySQL                                            |
| **Testing**      | PHPUnit (Unit & Integration), Codecov, GitHub CI |
| **Sandboxing**   | firejail-based (Secure Code Execution)           |
| **CI/CD**        | GitHub Actions (CI Done, CD Planned)             |

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

A solid test strategy ensures system reliability and developer confidence.

### ✅ Unit Testing

-   Written using **PHPUnit**
-   Covers:
    -   Core services
    -   Business logic
    -   Utility classes
-   Mocking used where necessary to isolate dependencies

### ✅ Integration Testing

-   Hits real **API endpoints**
-   Uses **real MySQL & Redis services** (Dockerized)
-   Verifies actual system behavior including:
    -   Database transactions
    -   Queued jobs
    -   Auth flows
-   Ensures both **success and failure paths** are tested
-   Database is reset or migrated cleanly between test runs

### ✅ Judge Simulation

-   End-to-end tests simulate actual code submission flows
-   The Judge service is mocked or stubbed for test environments
-   Supports future plug-in of a sandboxed Docker runner for full code evaluation

### 📊 Code Coverage (Partially Done)

GitHub CI badge support via `coverage.php` or `Xdebug`
Coverage reports via PHPUnit + Xdebug

**View the report:**

**Text:**

```bash
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
```

**HTML:**

```bash
php artisan test --coverage-html=storage/coverage-report

## System Design & Architecture

> **🎯 Main Goal:** Ensure **Scalability**, **Security**, and **Modularity**  
> Designed for real-time code evaluation at scale — CI/CD-ready, easily deployable, and structured for maintainability.
> Every commit makes sure the feature works.

-   🧩 **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** — feature-based modular structure supports toggling services (e.g., subscription model).
-   ⚙️ **Resource Limiting per Language** (CPU, Memory, Time) — prevents abuse and maximizing con-current user code execution
-   🕒 **Asynchronous Queue-Based Processing** — enables real-time non-blocking code execution for mass user submissions.
-   🔒 **Sandbox Execution** — securely runs untrusted code inside isolated environments.
-   🐳 **Dockerized Environment** — replicates production setup for local development, testing, and deployment.
-   🚀 **CI/CD from Day 1** — GitHub Actions handles linting, tests, and deployments for continuous integration.
-   🧪 **End-to-End Testing** — simulates full contest flows to ensure submission-to-verdict accuracy.

## 🧠 Development Notes (WIP)

-   🚧 Continuous Deployment (CD) setup pending & Demo gif
-   upcoming UX demo
-   best practices demo
-   ✅ Unit testing for core services
-   🧹 Static Analysis with PHPStan
-   🛠️ Integration testing in progress (DB setup ongoing)
-   Mocked judge service for end-to-end contest simulations : pending
-   🔄 Judge service simulation partially complete [java,nodejs,go]
-   📊 Code coverage + badge support (partially done)
-   Judge queue (RabbitMQ Queue) - currently laravel-queue used
-   Secure sandbox for code execution (Docker-based runner)
-   Use an in-memory or test database to avoid messing with production data.
-   Test both success and failure scenarios.
-   Clean up after tests in integration tests.
-   **🔁 Multiple Test Cases Support** - Judge handles **batch execution** of multiple input/output pairs efficiently.
-   **📥 Input/Output Console** - View raw inputs and outputs, making it easier to debug and improve your code.
-   **📊 Detailed Submission Reports** - Each submission shows **runtime**, **memory usage**, **compile output**, and **verdict (AC/WA/TLE/RE)**.
-   **🔒 Secure Execution (Planned)**  
    User code will run inside isolated **Docker sandboxes** to ensure security and performance.
-   **🕓 Submission History** - Track your progress with **timestamps, results, and code versioning** per problem.

-   **📈 Future Additions (Planned)**
    -   Leaderboards and rankings
    -   Problem-solving analytics
    -   Contest scheduling and participation
    -   Profile and badge system
