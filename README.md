# Competitive Programming Platform

![Laravel CI](https://github.com/ShaonMajumder/competitive-programming-platform/actions/workflows/laravel.yml/badge.svg)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ShaonMajumder/competitive-programming-platform/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ShaonMajumder/competitive-programming-platform)

A full-featured platform for compiling, executing, and judging code submissions across multiple languages — ideal for coding contests or training environments.

## 🚀 Demo

### 🛠️ Submission Engine Overview

### ✅ Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

**Figure:** GitHub Actions running PHPUnit tests, when pushed to main branch
![CI Demo](screenshots/ci_2025-05-19%2012-25-57.gif)

🔄 On each push/PR to main, GitHub Actions sets up PHP, MySQL, Redis, installs dependencies, configures Laravel, runs migrations & PHPUnit tests—failing on issues to block broken PRs.

➡️ Config: .github/workflows/laravel.yml

## 🎯 Features for Users

-   **📝 Online Code Editor**  
    Write and test code directly in the browser using a modern **Monaco Editor** (used by VS Code).

-   **🌐 Multi-Language Support**  
    Submit code in popular languages like **C++, Python**, and more (extensible).

-   **⚙️ Real-Time Code Evaluation**  
    Get instant feedback on submissions — outputs, errors, and verdicts are displayed in real-time.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

A solid test strategy ensures system reliability and developer confidence.

### ✅ Unit Testing

-   Written using **PHPUnit**
-   Covers:
    -   Core services
    -   Business logic
    -   Utility classes
-   Mocking used where necessary to isolate dependencies

### ✅ Integration Testing

-   Hits real **API endpoints**
-   Uses **real MySQL & Redis services** (Dockerized)
-   Verifies actual system behavior including:
    -   Database transactions
    -   Queued jobs
    -   Auth flows
-   Ensures both **success and failure paths** are tested
-   Database is reset or migrated cleanly between test runs

### ✅ Judge Simulation

-   End-to-end tests simulate actual code submission flows
-   The Judge service is mocked or stubbed for test environments
-   Supports future plug-in of a sandboxed Docker runner for full code evaluation

### 📊 Code Coverage (Partially Done)

GitHub CI badge support via `coverage.php` or `Xdebug`
Coverage reports via PHPUnit + Xdebug

**View the report:**

**Text:**

```bash
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
```

**HTML:**

```bash
php artisan test --coverage-html=storage/coverage-report

## 🛡️ Why It Stands Out - Engineering Best Practices

-   ✅ Follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) — feature-based module separation
-   ✅ Real-time system with asynchronous processing - Scalable queue-based design
-   Language Resource limits to prevent abuse & balance load (CPU/memory/time limits)
-   ✅ Uses Dockerized services to reflect production setup
-   ✅ CI/CD built-in from the ground up
-   🔒 Plans to integrate secure sandbox execution (Docker-based)
-   🧪 End-to-end simulation tests ensure contest flows are validated

## 🧠 Development Notes (WIP)

-   🚧 Continuous Deployment (CD) setup pending & Demo gif
-   upcoming UX demo
-   best practices demo
-   ✅ Unit testing for core services
-   🧹 Static Analysis with PHPStan
-   🛠️ Integration testing in progress (DB setup ongoing)
-   Mocked judge service for end-to-end contest simulations : pending
-   🔄 Judge service simulation partially complete [java,nodejs,go]
-   📊 Code coverage + badge support (partially done)
-   Judge queue (RabbitMQ Queue) - currently laravel-queue used
-   Secure sandbox for code execution (Docker-based runner)
-   Use an in-memory or test database to avoid messing with production data.
-   Test both success and failure scenarios.
-   Clean up after tests in integration tests.
-   **🔁 Multiple Test Cases Support** - Judge handles **batch execution** of multiple input/output pairs efficiently.
-   **📥 Input/Output Console** - View raw inputs and outputs, making it easier to debug and improve your code.
-   **📊 Detailed Submission Reports** - Each submission shows **runtime**, **memory usage**, **compile output**, and **verdict (AC/WA/TLE/RE)**.
-   **🔒 Secure Execution (Planned)**  
    User code will run inside isolated **Docker sandboxes** to ensure security and performance.
-   **🕓 Submission History** - Track your progress with **timestamps, results, and code versioning** per problem.

-   **📈 Future Additions (Planned)**
    -   Leaderboards and rankings
    -   Problem-solving analytics
    -   Contest scheduling and participation
    -   Profile and badge system
